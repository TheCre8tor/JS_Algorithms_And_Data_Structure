# Objectives

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving
  patterns including frequency counters,
  two pointer problems and divide and
  conquer.

# WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

- Algorithm is a process or set of steps
  to accomplish a certain task.

# WHY DO YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS?

- Almost everything that you do in programming involves
  some kind of algorithm!
- It's the foundation for being a successful problem
  solver and developer.

# HOW DO YOU IMPROVE?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
2. Master common problem solving pattterns.

# PROBLEM SOLVING

- Understand the problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break It Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor
