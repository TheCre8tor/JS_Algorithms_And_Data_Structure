# What is a logarithm?

A logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation.

# RULE

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number
of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get
a value that's less than or equal to one.

# WHO CARES

- Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time
  complexity.
- Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
- Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic
  space complexity.

# RECAP

- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use
  Big O Notation.
- Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding
  of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only
  about general trends (Constant, Linear, Quadratic)
- The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O)
  depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used
  to run the algorithm.
